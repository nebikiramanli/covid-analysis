# COVID-19 Predictive Analysis

This repository contains a COVID-19 predictive analysis project. The project aims to use machine learning techniques to forecast the spread and impact of the COVID-19 virus.


## Introduction

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many raw data that need to be processed in health, economic and social fields
have emerged all over the world. In this study, prediction analysis was performed using different methods from
the publicly available personal dataset shared on the kaggle platform, which includes the test results of patients
with Covid-19 symptoms. In the data set, breathing problem, fever, dry cough, sore throat, running nose, asthma,
mask usage status etc. The covid-19 positive test result was estimated based on health problems. It is aimed to
contribute to this field of health. Within the framework of prediction analysis, machine learning was evaluated
26
within the framework of machine learning stages, application areas and results. Thanks to the data of Covid-19
symptoms and machine learning methods, important results have been achieved with the data made sense from
certain diseases or environmental factors. In the study, Logistic Regression (96%), Nearest Neighbor (97%),
Decision Tree (97%), Artificial Neural Networks (98%), Gradient Boosting (98%), Extreme Gradient Boosting
(98%) and Support Vector machines (98%) produced successful predictions of algorithms rates. Fine tuning was
made using hyper parameter in the algorithms used, and a high rate of prediction success was achieved


## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from reputable public health organizations and government databases from Kaggle. It includes information such as the number of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and other relevant variables. The dataset is regularly updated to ensure the latest available information is used for analysis.
